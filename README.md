# FACTORIAL-OF-A-NUMBER
# FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER USING 8051 (Keil)

## AIM
To write and execute an Assembly language program to perform the factorial of a number using 8051 Keil.

---

## APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Personal computer with Keil software

---

## ALGORITHM
1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Read the number `n`.
3. **Initialize**:
   - Set factorial to `1`.
   - Set `i` to `1`.
4. **Loop**: While `i` is less than or equal to `n`:
   - Multiply factorial by `i`.
   - Increment `i` by `1`.
5. **Output**: Store or print the value of factorial.
6. **End**
